# DataScience-Portfolio

This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

The R portfolio is located here.
Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Contents
- ### Machine Learning

	- Predicting Customer Clicking Behavior: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

	- Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

	- Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

	- Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive: Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.

Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame

### Natural Language Processing
[3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/text_process-gitlab.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets.

Tools: NLTK, scikit

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- Python
	  -  [Customer Analytics](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/pentathlon_gitlab.ipynb) : Analysis of Customer Lifetime Value based on different time horizon of experiment.
	  -  [Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/tuango.ipynb) : Analysis of marketing plan based on Customer Lifetime Value based on different time horizon of experiment.

Tools: Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn and Matplotlib

#### R
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) 2013: Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory analysis of the BRFSS-2013 data set, focusing on investigating the relationship between education and eating habits, sleep and mental health, and smoking, drinking and general health of a person.
Inferential Statistics: Do men or women oppose sex education? : Using the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset to infer if, in the year 2012, were men, of 18 years or above in the United States, more likely to oppose sex education in public schools than women.
Data Visualization: Corruption and Human Development: A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries.
Moneyball: Analysing and replacing lost players: Exploration of baseball data for the year 2001 to look at replacements for key players lost by the Oakland A's in 2001. Inspired by the book/movie: Moneyball.

### Micro Projects:
#### Python

ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
Recipe Recommendations using Recommender Systems: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes Recipe recommendations based on user history

R
