# DataScience-Portfolio

This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.

Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.

## Contents
- ### Machine Learning

[Predicting Customer Clicking Behavior](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/tz-gaming-github.ipynb): Use Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad.

Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive: Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.

Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame

- ### Natural Language Processing
[3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/text_process-gitlab.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets.

[Text Mining](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/text_process-gitlab.ipynb): Perform text mining using unigram ,bigrams and FPMC model.

Tools: NLTK, scikit

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
[Customer Analytics](https://github.com/qi-chu/DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/pentathlon_gitlab.ipynb) : Analysis of Customer Lifetime Value based on different time horizon of experiment.

### Micro Projects:
#### Python
- ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
- ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
- Recipe Recommendations using Recommender Systems: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes Recipe recommendations based on user history

#### R

ML Logistic Regression: Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
ML Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.
